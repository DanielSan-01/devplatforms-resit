Brief

The market for development platforms is vast, varied and constantly changing. Select one of the products from the approved products list. Research this product and compile either a written report or video presentation on the subject.  

Your case study will be published to the Noroff Case Study library.

If there is an existing case study discussing your chosen product, consider these contribution options:

        Create a video companion to an existing written case study
        Create a text companion to an existing video case study
        Pick a particular feature, offering or aspect of this product to deep dive into


Your report or video should aim to introduce the product and demonstrate its use. It should also include a discussion of the productâ€™s history, applications, strengths/weaknesses, and how it compares to other products in the same category if applicable. You may adapt or go beyond the suggested format if you feel this is appropriate for your topic.

 

Approved products:

        Frontend/Backend tech: Solid.js, Preact, Bun.sh, Deno
        Build Systems: Turborepo, Nx
        State management/Data fetching: Zustand, SWR
        Deployment/Hosting: Render.com, Fly.io
        Design/Component lib: Chakra UI, Mantine.dev, Radix UI


Format

Case Studies are accepted in two formats:

        A markdown document
        A YouTube video embed


Markdown

Please submit a markdown document using this format as a structure.

You may include images in your case study but be wary of copyright restrictions. If you are unsure about copyright, please contact your course responsible.
 

YouTube

Please submit a markdown document using this format as a structure.

YouTube videos should attempt to follow the same structure as the markdown document. However, there may be more cause to deviate from this depending on the subject.

When viewing your YouTube video, select Share and then Embed. Copy the code from the Embed tab and paste it into your markdown document.

 

Working in Groups

You may work in groups of up to three students. If you are working in a group, please use a GitHub project board to allocate tasks so that the marker can check the distribution of labor. Please include the names of all group members in the credits for each case study.

 

Delivery
    Start by forking this repository.

        Create a branch for your case study using the name of your case study file. For example, product-case-study/product-case-study.md or product-video-case-study/product-video-case-study.md.
        Place your case study in the appropriate subdirectory under src/content/docs/. Commit your case study markdown file to your branch.
        Should an appropriate subdirectory not exist, you may create one with a suitable name. Please use lowercase and hyphens for the directory name, e.g. my-subdirectory.
        Open a Pull Request to the upstream main branch from your branch.
        Optionally request review from your peers.
        Submit the link to your open Pull Request.
